        <h1>How This is Calculated?</h1>
        <p>We uses the <a href="https://ecologits.ai/latest/">ecologits</a> package to calculate environmental impacts. Here, we provide a overview of the method. Please refer to the ecologits API reference for more information.</p>

        <h2>Calculation of Impacts</h2>
        <p>The impacts are further divided into:</p>
        
        <h3>Usage Impact</h3>
        <p>This refers to the energy consumption of the server during inference. The calculation involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Single GPU usage modeled using linear regression trained on Hugging Face’s LLM Leaderboard dataset, relating GPU energy per output token to the model’s active parameters.</li>
            <li>Predicting the energy consumption per output token based on the active parameter count of models not in the dataset (which may require educated guesses for unpublished data).</li>
            <li>Multiplying the single GPU usage with the estimated number of active GPUs required, which is determined by the memory needed to run the model.</li>
            <li>Summing this with the server energy usage without GPUs to obtain the total usage impact.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Embodied Impacts</h3>
        <p>These include resource extraction, hardware manufacturing, and transportation. The calculation involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using BoaviztAPI to estimate the embodied impacts.</li>
            <li>Allocating these impacts per request using a hardware utilization factor.</li>
        </ul>
