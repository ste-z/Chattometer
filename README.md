## Background 
“The rapid expansion of Generative AI is driving a dramatic increase in the need for data center capacity. For example, the power requirements for data centers under construction in North America soared from 2,688 MW at the end of 2022 to 5,341 MW by the end of 2023. This surge is on top of an expected addition of a staggering 12,000 MW of co-location capacity” (Bashir et al., 2025). 

BUT

“Most people are not aware of the resource usage underlying ChatGPT. If you’re not aware of the resource usage, then there’s no way that we can help conserve the resources”(O'Brien, Fingerhut, & Associated Press, 2023)

## Objectives

Our project develops an LLM impact  calculator to quantify and visualize daily LLM environmental impact, encouraging environmentally responsible behaviors. This tool will be applied as a Chrome extension including a feature where a virtual pet’s health reflects the impact of the user's LLM usage.
We also plan to write and release an data journalism piece with interactive visualizations and data storytelling to capture media attention and serve as a portal to the browser extension.
